## Migration Guides

### From R/metafor

```python
# R/metafor
# library(metafor)
# res <- rma(yi, vi, data=dat, method="REML")

# PyMeta equivalent
import pymeta as pm
result = pm.meta_analysis(data, model="random", tau2_method="reml")
```

### From RevMan

1. Export data from RevMan as CSV
2. Import into PyMeta
3. Configure analysis parameters
4. Generate results and plots

### From CMA

1. Export data to Excel/CSV format
2. Load data into PyMeta
3. Replicate analysis settings
4. Compare results for validation

## Performance Comparison
