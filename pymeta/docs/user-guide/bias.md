# Publication Bias Assessment

This guide covers methods for detecting and correcting publication bias in meta-analyses.

## Overview

Publication bias occurs when studies with significant or positive results are more likely to be published than those with non-significant or negative results.

## Detection Methods

### Funnel Plots

Visual assessment of publication bias using effect size vs. precision plots.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Create funnel plot
# Placeholder for code examples
```

### Statistical Tests

#### Egger's Test

Test for asymmetry in funnel plots.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Egger's regression test
# Placeholder for code examples
```

#### Begg's Test

Rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Begg's test
# Placeholder for code examples
```

#### PET-PEESE

Precision-Effect Test and Precision-Effect Estimate with Standard Error.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: PET-PEESE analysis
# Placeholder for code examples
```

## Correction Methods

### Trim-and-Fill

Impute missing studies to correct for publication bias.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Trim-and-fill analysis
# Placeholder for code examples
```

### Selection Models

Model the publication process explicitly.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Selection model
# Placeholder for code examples
```

### P-Curve Analysis

Assess evidential value using distribution of p-values.

```python
import pymeta

# Example: P-curve analysis
# Placeholder for code examples
```

## Sensitivity Analysis

Evaluate robustness of conclusions to potential publication bias.
