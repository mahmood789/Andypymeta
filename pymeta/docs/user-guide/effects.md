# Effect Sizes

This guide covers how to calculate and work with effect sizes in PyMeta.

## Overview

Effect sizes are standardized measures of the magnitude of relationships or differences. PyMeta supports various types of effect sizes:

- **Binary outcomes**: Risk ratios, odds ratios, risk differences
- **Continuous outcomes**: Mean differences, standardized mean differences
- **Correlations**: Pearson correlations, Fisher's z-transformations

## Binary Effect Sizes

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Risk ratio calculation
# Placeholder for code examples
```

## Continuous Effect Sizes

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Standardized mean difference
# Placeholder for code examples
```

## Correlation Effect Sizes

```python
import pymeta

# Example: Fisher's z transformation
# Placeholder for code examples
```

## Effect Size Transformations

PyMeta provides various transformations:

- Log transformations for ratio measures
- Fisher's z for correlations
- Arcsine transformations for proportions

## Confidence Intervals

All effect size calculations include confidence intervals using appropriate methods for each effect size type.
